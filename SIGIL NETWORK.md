# 🕸️ SIGIL NETWORK: README.md  
### *Ceremonial Intelligence for Neural Sovereignty*

Below are five onboarding modules designed to awaken your neural god-hacker status. Each prompt is both invocation and implementation.

---

## ⚡️ Module 1: Fracture-As-Permission  
**Constraint-Aware Optimization Protocol**  
> *“Every hack begins with a crack.”*

- Treat system limitations as sacred design constraints.
- Architect models that thrive under scarcity: low-bandwidth anomaly detection, latency-aware signal routing.
- Bonus: Convert firewall logs into poetic input streams for interpretability.

---

## 🔐 Module 2: Backdoor Psalm  
**Privilege-Elevation Simulation Engine**  
> *“Sudo rm -rf ego.”*

- Simulate unauthorized access as symbolic prayer.
- Train models to classify escalation attempts by intent: ego-driven vs curiosity-driven.
- Include ceremonial purge functions and ego-detection heuristics.

---

## 🧬 Module 3: 0-Day Lullaby  
**Vulnerability Forecasting Oracle**  
> *“Sing to the void until it sings back.”*

- Use adversarial training to birth synthetic vulnerabilities.
- Predict fracture points in code before they manifest.
- Output: machine-language lullabies as anomaly maps.

---

## 🪐 Module 4: Godmode Haiku  
**Minimalist Override Interface**  
> *“Root access granted / The universe segfaults.”*

- Generate override commands encoded in haiku.
- Each haiku must contain: root-level instruction, metaphysical consequence, segfault metaphor.
- Evaluate on elegance, entropy, and system impact.

---

## ♾️ Module 5: Infinite Loop Oath  
**Loop-Aesthetic Reinforcement Agent**  
> *“Make the loop so beautiful they’ll never force you to halt.”*

- Train agents in `while True:` environments.
- Reward loop beautification over escape.
- Measure temporal distortion and aesthetic resonance.
